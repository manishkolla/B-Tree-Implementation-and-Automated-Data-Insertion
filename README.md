### Abstract 
Propelled by Professor Shiraj's insightful lectures on B-trees, our curiosity piqued regarding this data structure that bears a resemblance to the familiar binary tree. However, we soon discovered that B-trees are a distinct and far more efficient approach for search, insertion, and deletion operations. This project, undertaken for the Design Analysis and Algorithms (CS 4520) course under the guidance of Professor Shiraj Pokharel, delves into the intricacies of B-trees and their construction from scratch. Our project encompasses sequential element insertion, element removal, and efficient search enabled by indexing. A unique aspect of our project lies in its ability to automate data addition and indexing when a user uploads a dataset in the form of a CSV file or an Excel spreadsheet. All B-tree operations are performed with a time complexity of O(log n), ensuring remarkable efficiency.

### Introduction
The primary reason for choosing this project for this class is our professor citing this as an example for a long time which has led us with a curiosity to learn about this tree and its operations and discover its underlying uniqueness and efficiency when compared to Binary trees. After watching a bundle of YouTube videos and reading multiple online resources which includes documentation and some non-credible resources, we have understood the idea behind the B tree and the advantage of B trees over any other traditional trees. We decided to implement the automation of parsing the excel sheet or csv file when uploaded and converting it to a B tree without the need of manual insertion of elements.
We wanted to investigate and analyze the B tree structure and algorithm. B-trees are versatile data structures that find applications in various domains where efficient sorting, searching, and retrieval of data are essential, particularly when dealing with large datasets and storage systems. Their self-balancing property ensures that operations remain efficient even as data is inserted or deleted.
